# VHDL

#Making a game on the FPGA Basys Board, using the Led and the Button. 

#The objective of this project was to display the ability to write the vhdl code that allows us to create a game concept on the Basys3 board.

#We use the Seven segment Display on the FPGA board to display the score.
#Joystick button are used to serve the LED from either left or right. When the left button is pressed the LED is served from the left and when the right button is pressed
#the LED is served from he right.

#When the player turns thw switch on, the LED hits the switch and then bounces back to the direction it was served.

#If the ball bounces the switch and drops to one side of the board, the score is display on the seven segment display.

#A video link explains the project.
